		<p>Eggscellent has a variety of sounds for your timer, timer completion alert, and break completion alert.</p>

		<p>To choose which sounds you would like to use for each of these, open the preferences window, and select the Audio section. Here you can choose which sounds you would like to use, or choose no sound at all.</p>

		<p>You can even set your own custom alert. This gives you the ability to have a specific song from your iTunes library play while you work, and another track play to alert you when your timer is up.</p>

		<p>Audio volume can be raised or lowered in this same section.</p>
