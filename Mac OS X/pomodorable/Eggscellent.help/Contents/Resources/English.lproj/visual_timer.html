        <div id="content">
	<p>When a task is started, a timer window will appear. As your pomodoro progresses, the tomato will grow from unripened green into lush, juicy red.</p>
	
	<p>The task ribbons are also color coordinated, depending upon how many pomodoros are assigned to that task. For example, if you have 7 pomodoros for a task, the ribbon will change color with each completed pomodoro, from green to yellow to orange to red. Hover your mouse over the window to track distractions or stop the timer.</p>
	
	<h3>Toggling Visual Timer</h3>
	<p>If you would like to turn the visual timer off, simply go into preferences, select audio, and uncheck the “display hover window” box.</p>
	
	<h3>Change Visual Timer above all windows</h3>
	<p>To change whether or not you want Pomodorable to hover above all windows or not, go into preferences, then select the general tab.</p>
	<p>To have the visual timer above all windows, ensure that "keep visual timer on top" is selected. To have it behave like regular windows, ensure the option is not selected.</p>
