	<p>When a task is started, a timer window will appear. As your timer progresses, the egg timer will tick along. When your timer is complete the egg will hatch!</p>
	
	<p>The task ribbon is color coordinated depending on the size of your task. For instance, if you 8 timers assigned to that task, the ribbon color will be a darker orange than if you had 4.</p>
	
	<h3>Toggling Visual Timer</h3>
	<p>If you would like to turn the visual timer off, simply go into preferences, select audio, and uncheck the “display hover window” box. A keyboard shortcut is also available to set in preferences.</p>
	
	<h3>Change Visual Timer above all windows</h3>
	<p>To change whether or not you want Eggscellent to hover above all windows or not, go into preferences, then select the general tab.</p>
	<p>To have the visual timer above all windows, ensure that "keep visual timer on top" is selected. To have it behave like regular windows, ensure the option is not selected.</p>
