<p>A task represents an item in the main Eggscellent list window that is something to be completed. The task is broken into the following components</p>

<p>Task Ribbon:<br/>A color coordinated, depending upon the size task. For example, if you have 8 timers for a task, the ribbon will be a darker orange than a smaller sized task.</p>

<p>Timer Counter: A series of filled or unfilled dots indicating how many timers you have estimated for a particular task</p>

<p>External and Internal Distractions: Provide the total amount of distractions recorded over all timers completed for a task</p>

<h3>To add a task</h3>

<p>1. Click the “+” button at the bottom left of the window.<br/>
2. Click on the “new task” text to rename. You can add or subtract time increments with the “+” and “-” buttons underneath the bar of each task.<br/>
3. Select the task you would like to begin work on, and click the “Start” button at the bottom-right of the menu.</p>

<h3>Removing a task</h3>
<p>To remove a task, select it and hit the delete key. Note: If you select the text within a task, then the delete key will only remove the text, not the task.</p>

<h3>Editing a Task</h3>
<p>To edit a task name, select the task and press the enter button or double click to allow for editing. To change the estimated size for a task, press the "+" or "-" buttons on the right hand side of a selected task.</p>

<h3>Completing a Task</h3>
<p>There are two ways to mark a task as complete:<br/>

<ul>
