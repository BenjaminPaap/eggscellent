		<p>Pomodorable currently integrates with Things, OmniFocus, and OS X Reminders. To choose one of these apps to use with Pomodorable, click on the preferences button located at the top-right of the task window. Select Integration, and choose which task manager you want to use.</p>
		
		<h3>Things Integration</h3>
		<p>When using Things, add (or move) a task to your Today list, and it will appear in Pomodorable. You can use the Tags feature in Things to size up how many pomodoros your task will take. Once your task is completed, click on the ribbon, and it will be marked as completed in Things.</p>
		
		<h3>OmniFocus Integration</h3>
		<p>When using OmniFocus, choose the “Due” perspective and click “Add Action” and enter your task. While the task is selected, click the Inspect button and set the start date and due date to today. If the task is due at a later date, it will not show up in Pomodorable until that day. Once you’ve finished setting up your task, open Pomodorable, and your tasks for today will be listed. Select which task you would like to begin and click “Start” in the bottom-right corner. You can filter out unsized tasks by going into Pomodorable Preferences, and choosing Integration.</p>
		
		<h3>Reminders Integration</h3>
		<p>Pomodorable integrates natively with OS X Reminders when selected as your task manager. Set a date for a task, and it will appear in Pomodorable on that day. Pomodorable’s deep integration allows you to edit and complete a reminder by changing the text and clicking on the ribbon.</p>
