		<p>Eggscellent currently integrates with Things, OmniFocus, and OS X Reminders. To choose one of these apps to use with Eggscellent, click on the preferences button located at the top-right of the task window. Select Integration, and choose which task manager you want to use.</p>
		
		<h3>Things Integration</h3>
		<p>When using Things, add (or move) a task to your Today list, and it will appear in Eggscellent. Once your task is completed, click on the ribbon, and it will be marked as completed in Things.</p>
		
		<h3>OmniFocus Integration</h3>
		<p>When using OmniFocus, mark any task as flagged to have it show up in Eggscellent. Once you’ve finished setting up your task, open Eggscellent, and your tasks for today will be listed. Select which task you would like to begin and click “Start” in the bottom-right corner. You can filter out unsized tasks by going into Eggscellent Preferences, and choosing Integration.</p>
		
		<h3>Reminders Integration</h3>
		<p>Eggscellent integrates natively with OS X Reminders when selected as your task manager. Set a date for a task, and it will appear in Eggscellent on that day. Eggscellent’s deep integration allows you to edit and complete a reminder by changing the text and clicking on the ribbon.</p>
