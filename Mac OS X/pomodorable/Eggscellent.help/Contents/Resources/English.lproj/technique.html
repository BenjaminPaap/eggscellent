			<h3>About The Pomodoro Technique®</h3>
			<p>The Pomodoro Technique® is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down periods of work into 25-minute intervals called 'Pomodoros' (from the Italian word for 'tomatoes') separated by breaks. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.</p>

			<p>There are five basic steps to implementing the technique:<br/>
			1) decide on the task to be done<br/><br/>

			2) set the pomodoro (timer) to 25 minutes<br/><br/>

			3) work on the task until the timer rings<br/><br/>

			4) take a short break (5 minutes)<br/><br/>

			5) every four "pomodoros" take a longer break (15–20 minutes)<br/><br/>
